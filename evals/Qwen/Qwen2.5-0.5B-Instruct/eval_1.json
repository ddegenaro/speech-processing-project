Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, while reflecting green light.\n\n2. **Photolysis (Photochemical Reaction)**: Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. This causes them to become excited, releasing electrons that can be used for energy production.\n\n3. **Electron Transport Chain**: The excited chlorophyll molecules donate their electrons to an electron transport chain. This chain consists of several protein complexes connected by proteins called respiratory chains. As electrons flow along this chain, they release protons, creating an electrochemical gradient.\n\n4. **Calvin Cycle (Carbon Fixation)**: The proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane moves down its concentration gradient.
